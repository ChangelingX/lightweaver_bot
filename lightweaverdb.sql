This is the revised edition of Kosho Uchiyama’s singularly incisive classic.\n\nThis new edition contains even more useful material: new prefaces, an index, and extended endnotes, in addition to a revised glossary. As Jisho Warner writes in her preface, Opening the Hand of Thought “goes directly to the heart of Zen practice. . . showing how Zen Buddhism can be a deep and life-sustaining activity.” She goes on to say, “Uchiyama looks at what a person is, what a self is, how to develop a true self not separate from all things, one that can settle in peace in the midst of life.”\n\nBy turns humorous, philosophical, and personal, Opening the Hand of Thought is above all a great book for the Buddhist practitioner. It’s a perfect follow-up for the reader who has read Zen Meditation in Plain English and is especially useful for those who have not yet encountered a Zen teacher.','\n',char(10)));
INSERT INTO books VALUES(2,'Peace Is Every Step','Thich Nhat Hahn','553351397','https://plumvillage.org/books/peace-is-every-step/',replace('Peace Is Every Step\n\nThe Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life\n\nIn this book Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations in our daily life that usually pressure and antagonise us. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next conscious breath and the smile we can form right now. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to “mindfulness”—the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality.\n\nZen Master Thich Nhat Hanh is a global spiritual leader, poet and peace activist, revered around the world for his pioneering teachings on mindfulness, global ethics and peace.','\n',char(10)));
INSERT INTO books VALUES(3,'Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving','Pete Walker','1492871842','http://pete-walker.com/complex_ptsd_book.html',replace('\n    My new book, Complex PTSD: From Surviving To Thriving, elaborates extensively on all the recovery concepts explained on this website. Unlike the articles here, however, it is oriented toward the layperson. As such, much of the psychological jargon and dense concentration of concepts in the articles has been replaced with expanded and easier to follow explanations. Moreover, many principles that were only sketched out are explained in much greater detail. A great deal of new material is also explored. It is also copiously illustrated with examples of my own and others'''' journeys of recovering.\n\n    The book also functions as a map to help you understand the somewhat linear progression of recovery and the maze of complex tasks that are necessary for effective recovery. It can also help you to identify what you may have already accomplished, and help you to figure out what is best to work on and prioritize now. This in turn also serves to help you identify the signs that you are recovering, and to develop reasonable expectations about the rate of your recovery.\n\n    Complex PTSD: From Surviving To Thriving is also oriented toward those who do not have Cptsd but who want to understand and help a loved one who does.\n\n    If you felt unwanted, unliked, rejected, hated and/or despised for a lengthy portion of your childhood, this trauma may have left you with unnecessary, lingering effects.\n\n    I hope this map and guidebook will aid you to heal in a way that helps you to become an unflinching source of kindness and self-compassion for yourself, and that on that journey you will find at least one other human being who will reciprocally care for you in that way.\n','\n',char(10)));
